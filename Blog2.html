             Hi, I am Rupali & I welcome you to my blog.</p>

            <b>Journey into Outreachy</b> -  Outreachy is an internship program that supports diversity in free and open-source software. I’m an Outreachy intern at Mozilla on the project “Create user experience design proposal for Firefox Preview on Android (Fenix)”.

        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            The motivation behind my application was:
            </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
             -  Contributing to open source and supporting diversity in tech.<br>
             -  Tackling problems with a mentor alongside.<br>
             -  Opportunity to work on a project remotely with a team of international professionals.<br>
             -  Chance of networking with fellow interns and professionals. <br>
             </p>
             <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
                After my initial application got accepted(which mainly consisted of some essay type questions) I had to choose projects to contribute. 
                Luckily, I found some projects that I could contribute to. In the beginning, it was confusing on what to choose or how to choose. 
                So I started with 3 projects in hand and did a choice by elimination as I indulged more into the project  
                “Create user experience design proposal for Firefox Preview on Android (Fenix)”.  
            </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;"> 
                So as soon as I became confident I started setting up my project and then creating a good first issue. 
                It was a bit intimidating with all other contributors but when my first issue got accepted I was motivated to countinue.
                Outreachy required atleast one contribution but I tried contributing every other day when I got time. It was like a learning experience as I had my mentor and fellow contributors to discuss.
                By the time of the last date of application submission, I had several 6 issues on my repo. I submitted my final application and kept contributing afterward.
         </p>
         <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;"> 
         It was hard to wait for the results. I was impatiently counting days nervously therewith the infamous Covid 19 happend. I was losing hope as everything was going upside down. But then the news of acceptance arrived it was like finding a tresure after a year of excavation. I was on cloud nine that day. A sense of achievement I strived for life. 
        </p> 
        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;"> 
            Finally, Now, I am a journey of learning by working on a real project with mentors in one of the world’s top tech companies. It's amazing.
