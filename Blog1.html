         <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 16px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            So here it goes, my first ever blog.</p> 
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 16px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
             Hi, I am Rupali & I welcome you to my blog.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 16px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            <b>A quick introduction</b> - I’m from India, currently completing my B. architecture from IIT Roorkee. I’m interested in interaction design and passionate about creating designs that are cutting edge and have the highest level of usability. </p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 16px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            <b>Meet fun Rupali</b> -  I’m a mountain hiker and an explorer. I’m always curious about different cultures and their cuisines. The euphoria that it brings to me therewith it let me study human behaviour and cross-cultural psychology.
            I love music and attend quite a few music concerts. 
             </p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 16px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            <b>What I believe</b> -  Well, I believe that belief changes over time (pun intended) but at this point of life, I value Competency, Compassion and Growth. 
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 2px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            - Competence is a stage of a perfect outcome with a background of thought and hard work. I try to put in continuous efforts and achieve that level. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 2px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            - I value growth, (personal, professional & physical), with every task that I do I want to be a better version of myself.  
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 2px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            - I believe a Human is someone who is compassionate. I try to be supportive of fellow human beings and other animals. Understanding one’s expressions and frustrations allow me to be helpful.
             
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 16px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            <b>Journey into Outreachy</b> -  Outreachy is an internship program that supports diversity in free and open-source software. I’m an Outreachy intern at Mozilla on the project “Create user experience design proposal for Firefox Preview on Android (Fenix)”.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
            The motivation behind my application was:
            </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
             -  Contributing to open source and supporting diversity in tech.<br>
             -  Tackling problems with a mentor alongside.<br>
             -  Opportunity to work on a project remotely with a team of international professionals.<br>
             -  Chance of networking with fellow interns and professionals. <br>
             </p>
             <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;">
                After my initial application got accepted(which mainly consisted of some essay type questions) I had to choose projects to contribute. 
                Luckily, I found some projects that I could contribute to. In the beginning, it was confusing on what to choose or how to choose. 
                So I started with 3 projects in hand and did a choice by elimination as I indulged more into the project  
                “Create user experience design proposal for Firefox Preview on Android (Fenix)”.  
            </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;"> 
                So as soon as I became confident I started setting up my project and then creating a good first issue. 
                It was a bit intimidating with all other contributors but when my first issue got accepted I was motivated to countinue.
                Outreachy required atleast one contribution but I tried contributing every other day when I got time. It was like a learning experience as I had my mentor and fellow contributors to discuss.
                By the time of the last date of application submission, I had several 6 issues on my repo. I submitted my final application and kept contributing afterward.
         </p>
         <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;"> 
         It was hard to wait for the results. I was impatiently counting days nervously therewith the infamous Covid 19 happend. I was losing hope as everything was going upside down. But then the news of acceptance arrived it was like finding a tresure after a year of excavation. I was on cloud nine that day. A sense of achievement I strived for life. 
        </p> 
        <p style="margin-left: 20%;font-size: 120%;margin-right: 20%;margin-top: 10px;letter-spacing: 1px;"> 
            Finally, Now, I am a journey of learning by working on a real project with mentors in one of the world’s top tech companies. It's amazing.
